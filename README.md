# The Bare Necessities
A solid base for personal C++ projects using nix, cmake, gmock, and gtest and jinja templates


## Here's my planned next steps in no particular order
```
* integrate some sort of code profiling

* clean up build scripts so that there is more control over what tests/apps get built or run

* auto generate projects in addition to modules?

* clean up directory structure

* fix paths in jinja so that it works from nix-build (currently only works in nix-shell)
```
